### What is the Pipeline in PowerShell?

The **pipeline** in PowerShell allows you to send the output of one cmdlet directly to another, processing objects in sequence to filter, sort, and manipulate data efficiently for system automation and management.

- **Chaining Cmdlets**: The pipeline connects multiple cmdlets together, where the output of one cmdlet becomes the input of the next. This allows you to perform a series of operations in a streamlined fashion.
- **Efficient Data Handling**: PowerShell processes objects one at a time in the pipeline, which is highly efficient when dealing with large datasets or complex data structures.
- **Streamlined Automation**: By combining multiple operations into a single command, the pipeline simplifies complex automation tasks and reduces the need for temporary variables or intermediate steps.
- **Flexibility**: The pipeline allows for flexible processing of data, making it easy to query, filter, manipulate, and format data from various system resources such as files, services, and processes.
- **Output Transformation**: You can transform, format, or select specific properties from objects in the pipeline, providing customized views of the data being processed.
- **Error Handling**: The pipeline can also be used for error handling. Cmdlets can be chained with error-catching mechanisms like `Try`, `Catch`, or `ErrorAction` to ensure smooth execution.

#### Basic Syntax:
```powershell
<cmdlet1> | <cmdlet2> | <cmdlet3> ...
